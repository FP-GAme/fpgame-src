# FP-GAme Source
FP-GAme is a retro video game console bundled with a development kit. The
project was developed at Carnegie Mellon University for the 2021 ECE Capstone
Design course by our team of two: Andrew Spaulding and Joseph Yankel.

This repository holds the source files required to build the hardware (FPGA
configuration) and system software (kernel modules, user libraries). Also
included are build instructions and a build script for automating building
of the SD Card image.

Each subfolder has its own brief README description. For information on the build
process, see docs/build_from_source_guide.pdf.
